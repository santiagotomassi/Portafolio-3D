                        <h1>Summary</h1>
                        <p>I'm a Industrial design student with 5+ years of
                            experience in the 3D field. During this time, I've worked
                            on character design, object modeling, and art creation.
                            I'm also the co-founder of GOB Labs Studio, where we
                            specialize in 3D modeling and animation for
                            productions. I'm now seeking to enhance my skills and
                            expand my knowledge in the 3D world. Let's create some
                            cool stuff together!
